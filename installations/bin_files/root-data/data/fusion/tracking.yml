---
track_thresh : 0.5
#  {0,1} - confidence threshold for detections to be included in tracking
# 
high_thresh : 0.4
#  {0,1} - confidence threshold for high confidence detections
# 
match_thresh : 0.9
#  {0,1} - matching threshold for tracking - higher values indicates minimum ID switches, lower values may have ID switching
# 
frame_rate : 20
#  frame-rate for tracking
# 
track_buffer : 120
#  number of frames for which a track should be kept in memory if the track is lost.
# 
NMS_thresh : 0.7
#  {0,1} Non-Maximal-Suppression threshold for the detector - to avoid multiple detections for a single person
# 
bbox_conf_thresh : 0.2
#  {0,1} confidence threshold for low confidence detections
#

#  The above values act as the default values for each of the 80 classes supported by this SDK.  
#  However, the following threshold values can be set for individual classes:
#       bbox_conf_thresh (bct)
#       high_thresh (ht)
#       track_thresh (tt)
#
#  Each class is refered with an id. For id 'x', 
#       'x_bct' will set the bbox_conf_thresh, 
#       'x_ht' will set the high_thresh, 
#       'x_tt' will set the track_thresh
#
#  For example:
#       0_bct : 0.1
#       0_tt : 0.3
#  This will set the 'bbox_conf_thresh' and 'track_thresh' for class 'Person' as 0.1 and 0.3 respectively. 
#  Rest of the classes will have 'bbox_conf_thresh' set to the value set above(0.2 in our case).
